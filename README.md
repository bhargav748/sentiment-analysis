# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves building a sentiment analysis model using the **movie_reviews** dataset from NLTK. The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content. We use Python libraries such as NLTK for natural language processing, Pandas for data handling, and Scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load movie reviews and their sentiment labels from the NLTK dataset.
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and encode text and labels.
- **Data Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Train and evaluate a machine learning model for sentiment analysis.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Uses NLTK's `movie_reviews` corpus to fetch movie reviews and labels.
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Converts text into a format suitable for machine learning.
   - Encodes sentiment labels as numerical values.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - Trains a sentiment classification model.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates model performance on test data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:
